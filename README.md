NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python, and it provides various functions that are essential for machine learning tasks. Below, I'll list some unique, simple, and advanced functions in NumPy that are commonly used in machine learning:

Unique and Simple Functions:

    numpy.array: Create an array from a list or tuple.
    numpy.zeros: Create an array filled with zeros.
    numpy.ones: Create an array filled with ones.
    numpy.eye: Create an identity matrix (square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere).
    numpy.random.rand: Generate random numbers from a uniform distribution (0 to 1).
    numpy.random.randn: Generate random numbers from a standard normal distribution (mean 0, standard deviation 1).
    numpy.argmax: Return the indices of the maximum values in an array.
    numpy.argmin: Return the indices of the minimum values in an array.
    numpy.unique: Return unique elements of an array.

Advanced Functions:

    numpy.dot: Matrix multiplication of two arrays.
    numpy.matmul: Matrix multiplication for arrays with more than two dimensions.
    numpy.transpose: Transpose an array (swap rows and columns).
    numpy.linalg.inv: Compute the inverse of a matrix.
    numpy.linalg.eig: Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix.
    numpy.linalg.svd: Compute the singular value decomposition of a matrix.
    numpy.mean: Compute the mean along a specified axis.
    numpy.std: Compute the standard deviation along a specified axis.
    numpy.var: Compute the variance along a specified axis.
    numpy.histogram: Compute the histogram of a set of data.

These functions cover a range of functionalities required for various machine learning tasks, including data preprocessing,
linear algebra, statistics, and random number generation. 
Understanding and using these NumPy functions effectively can greatly enhance the efficiency and capability of machine learning workflows in Python.
